TinyXML-2
	TinyXML-2 is released under the ZLib license, 
	so you can use it in open source or commercial code. The details
	of the license are at the top of every source file.

	TinyXML-2 attempts to be a flexible parser, but with truly correct and
	compliant XML output. TinyXML-2 should compile on any reasonably C++
	compliant system. It does not rely on exceptions, RTTI, or the STL.
